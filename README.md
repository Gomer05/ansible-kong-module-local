# ansible-kong-module
Ansible module for configuring Kong / Kong Enterprise

This is based on https://github.com/Klarrio/ansible-kong-module but has been heavily modified to work with Kong Enterprise

The develop branch is just the core .py files that do all the heavy lifting and can be worked on here.
